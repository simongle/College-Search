As Capella is not a research institution, instructors are paid to teach, not participate in research activities. Thus, while many institutions reporting to IPEDS have significant research expenses that are captured here, Capella reports only direct instructional expenses. Furthermore, the “instructional expenses” definition does not include those functions which support teaching and learning, which is an area of significant investment at Capella. In addition, the mostly online, asynchronous nature of our courses and commitment to student experience across all aspects of the collegiate experience require much larger investments in IT infrastructure, which are not accounted in the IPEDS instructional expense definition."
